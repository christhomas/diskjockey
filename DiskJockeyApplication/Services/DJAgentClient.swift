    /// What the agent must prove before this app will talk to it.
    ///
    /// The agent checks US — `DiskJockeyAgent/main.swift` pins a
    /// requirement on every incoming connection — and until now nothing
    /// checked IT. Authentication in one direction is not
    /// authentication: the mach name
    /// `com.antimatterstudios.diskjockey.agent` is registered from
    /// `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, which the user can write to without
    /// authorisation, so any process running as the user could claim
    /// the name and receive `attachImage(atPath:)`,
    /// `detachDevice(_:)` and `mountFSKit(...)` from a sandboxed app
    /// that believed it was talking to its own helper.
    ///
    /// `anchor apple generic` is the half that does the work: it
    /// requires an Apple-issued certificate chain, which a locally
    /// produced binary cannot forge. The team check then narrows that
    /// to our own signing identity.
    ///
    /// The agent's code-signing IDENTIFIER is deliberately not pinned.
    /// It is not a committed Xcode target — it is built by
    /// `scripts/install-agent-dev.sh` from DerivedData — so its
    /// identifier is not fixed anywhere this code can read, and pinning
    /// a guess would fail closed: the connection would be invalidated
    /// with no error at the call site, which is worse than the gap
    /// being fixed. Tighten this the day the agent becomes a real
    /// target.
    ///
    /// The team ID is also spelled in `DiskJockeyAgent/main.swift` as
    /// `kTeamID`. Two copies, because the agent is not an Xcode target
    /// and shares no compilation unit with the app — if one is ever
    /// changed without the other, the app and its helper stop being
    /// able to talk and neither says why. Change both.
