//
//  ReadOnlyVolumeSupport.swift — the parts of a read-only FSKit volume
//  that are the same for every filesystem, in the one place a test can
//  reach them.
//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS
//
//  DiskJockey has four read-only volumes — XFS, Btrfs, EROFS and
//  SquashFS. Normalising the filesystem's name away and diffing them
//  pairwise gives 88% to 98% identical lines; XFS and Btrfs differ in
//  six lines out of 370. They are one class written four times, and the
//  copies have already drifted: the XFS volume shipped with
//  `supportsJournal = false`, inherited from the EROFS volume it was
//  copied from, and XFS has a journal.
//
//  None of that was catchable by a test. The volume classes live in the
//  extension appex targets, and a test bundle that links the app cannot
//  see them — `cannot find 'XfsVolume' in scope`. So every volume test
//  in this project mirrors the volume's wiring against a mock instead of
//  exercising the volume, and a mirror asserts only what the mirror was
//  written to say.
//
//  This module is the fix: the decisions that differ between filesystems
//  live here as data and plain functions, in a target the tests already
//  cover. What stays in each extension is the C ABI call and the
//  conversion into these types.
//
//  FSKit's own types are used directly rather than shadowed. That was
//  worth checking rather than assuming — the existing volume tests carry
//  a comment saying FSKit types "can't easily be constructed in a
//  unit-test bundle", which is not true: `FSItem.Attributes()` and
//  `FSStatFSResult(fileSystemTypeName:)` both build and run in
//  DiskJockeyLibraryTests.
