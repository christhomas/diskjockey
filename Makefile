# fs-ext4 is built from vendored source via git submodule at vendor/rust-fs-ext4/.
# The build is handled by scripts/build-fs-ext4.sh which is called both by
# the Makefile (for manual/CI builds) and by Xcode build phases.
# Output: lib/fs_ext4/fs_ext4.xcframework (universal binary + headers)
# Xcode's DiskJockeyEXT4 target links the XCFramework via its bridging header.

# Build fs-ext4 using the shared build script (used by both Makefile and Xcode)
# Force rebuild even if sources haven't changed
# Build fs-ntfs using the shared build script
# Build fs-squashfs (read-only) using the shared build script
# Build fs-erofs (read-only) using the shared build script
# Disk-image container readers (am-img-qcow2/vhd/vhdx/vmdk). Each crate
# builds to its own universal static lib at lib/img_<name>/. Consumers
# (DiskJockeyEXT4, DiskJockeyNTFS) link each .a individually — they are
# NOT bundled into libfs_ext4.a or libfs_ntfs.a. See
# `feedback_no_cross_domain_bundling` in the project memory for why.
# Per-extension aggregator staticlibs: one lib per FSKit extension combining
# its driver + the img container readers (crates.io), so each extension links
# a single Rust staticlib with std embedded once. See scripts/build-bundles.sh.

# commit or build for distribution. See scripts/dev-link.sh for the rationale.

# tag + SHA for every vendored submodule is visible from GitHub's file
# view and from a plain `cat` without needing any git commands.
#
# Regenerate + stage alongside every submodule bump. `make pins-check`
# fails if the on-disk file is stale — wire it into CI if/when we have
# CI for this repo.
