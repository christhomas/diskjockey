# SUPERSEDED 2026-08-27 — NOTHING CALLS THIS. `chore pins:check` replaced it.
#
# It compares VENDOR_PINS.txt against `git submodule status`. The libraries
# moved to SIBLING checkouts (../rust-fs-ext4 and friends) and `chore pins`
# now reads those, so the file it validates no longer has a `vendor/` column
# for it to match. Run as-is against the current manifest it exits 1 having
# printed NOTHING AT ALL: `grep '^vendor/'` matches nothing, and under
# `set -euo pipefail` that kills the assignment before any diagnostic runs.
#
# Left on disk deliberately rather than deleted. The callers are gone:
#   .githooks/pre-commit.d/project-vendor-pins.sh  -> chore pins  + git add
#   .github/workflows/ci.yml                       -> chore pins:check
#
# Everything below this banner is the old implementation, unchanged.
#
# check-vendor-pins.sh — validate that VENDOR_PINS.txt SHA column matches
# the current submodule gitlinks.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-vendor-pins.sh [pins-file]
#
#   pins-file defaults to VENDOR_PINS.txt in the repo root.
#   Pass a temp file to validate a staged (not yet committed) version.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = OK, 1 = stale or missing pins
#
# Called by:
#   .githooks/pre-commit  — checks staged VENDOR_PINS.txt against staged submodule SHAs
#   scripts/ci.yml        — checks committed VENDOR_PINS.txt against checked-out SHAs
