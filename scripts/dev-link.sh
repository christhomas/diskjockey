# dev-link.sh — put a driver bundle into LOCAL-DEV mode so you can hack on a
# vendored crate's source and test it in the app WITHOUT publishing a new
# crates.io version each time.
#
# Distribution builds resolve every driver from crates.io (the published,
# proven versions). For local co-development that round-trip is too slow, so
# this appends a `[patch.crates-io]` block to the bundle's Cargo.toml that
# redirects the driver — and the shared `am-fs-core` — to the sibling
# submodules. Edit the submodule source, rebuild, see the change immediately.
#
# IMPORTANT: a dev-linked bundle is NOT distribution-clean. Do not commit it.
# Run scripts/dev-unlink.sh <fs> (or `make dev-unlink FS=<fs>`) to restore.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dev-link.sh <ext4|ntfs|erofs|squashfs> [extra-crate ...]
#     extra-crate: also redirect another crate to its local submodule, e.g.
#                  `am-img-qcow2` to co-develop the qcow2 reader. (See the
#                  ntfs caveat in the memory: ntfs + a local img reader can
#                  reintroduce a core-path split.)
