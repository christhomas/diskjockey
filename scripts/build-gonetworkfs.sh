# build-gonetworkfs.sh — put the go-networkfs c-archives where the app links
# them.
#
# WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY THIS IS NOW SHORT
#
# This used to carry the build itself: 258 lines that knew Go's flags, the
# driver list, the c-archive invocation and its own stamp-file staleness
# scheme. All of that is knowledge about how to build go-networkfs, and it
# belongs to go-networkfs — which now states it, in its own chores.yml, as
# `chore archives` (build every driver plus the combined dispatcher) and
# `chore artifact` (say where they landed). The same contract every sibling
# Rust crate publishes.
#
# So this script no longer builds anything. It resolves the pinned tag and
# hands off to sibling-build.sh, which builds it in a throwaway worktree of
# that tag. When the driver list or a Go flag changes, it changes once, in
# go-networkfs, and every consumer follows.
#
# WHERE THE SOURCE COMES FROM
#
# A sibling checkout, not a vendored submodule. The submodule was a second
# copy of a repository already on disk — 146 MB of it — and a checkout shared
# with every other project that wants it is the point of the move. Override
# with NETWORKFS_SRC when it lives somewhere else.
#
# The checkout supplies git objects only. WHAT GETS COMPILED IS THE TAG NAMED
# IN SIBLING_PINS.txt, built in a worktree, so the developer's branch and
# working state cannot reach the app's binary.
