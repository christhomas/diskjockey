# sibling-build.sh — build a sibling project at its pinned tag, in a
# throwaway worktree, and hand back where the outputs landed.
#
# WHY A WORKTREE RATHER THAN THE CHECKOUT ITSELF
#
# The sibling projects are no longer vendored submodules, so nothing pins
# what is on disk. A developer's checkout is on whatever branch they were
# last working on, possibly dirty, possibly mid-merge — that last one is not
# hypothetical, it happened during the change that introduced this script and
# the build failed with `malformed module path "<<<<<<<"`.
#
# Building from a worktree of a pinned tag means the artifact that goes into
# the app is the same one on every machine, no matter what state the
# developer left their checkout in. The checkout supplies git objects; it
# never supplies the source that gets compiled.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS, MEASURED
#
#   reuse the checkout (chore fingerprint hit)   0.01s
#   fresh worktree, shared build cache           8.7s
#   fresh worktree, cold build cache             20.6s
#
# The cost is real and it is the point: `.chore/` lives inside the worktree,
# so a throwaway tree cannot reuse the previous run's fingerprints and every
# build is a full one. Language-level caches that live outside the tree
# (GOCACHE, CARGO_HOME) still apply, which is why the middle number is not
# the last one.
#
# SUBMODULES ARE THE AWKWARD CASE
#
# `git worktree remove` REFUSES outright on a worktree containing submodules:
#
#   fatal: working trees containing submodules cannot be moved or removed
#
# rust-fs-ntfs has two. So removal escalates — plain remove, then --force,
# then an explicit delete — and the result is VERIFIED rather than assumed,
# because a half-removed worktree leaves a registration that breaks the next
# build with a confusing "already exists".
#
# WHEN THE CHECKOUT IS ON main, IT IS USED DIRECTLY — IF IT IS CLEAN
#
# A worktree exists to escape whatever branch someone is working on. If they
# are on main with nothing modified, there is nothing to escape: the checkout
# already IS the reference state, and using it reuses the chore fingerprint
# cache, which is the difference between 0.01s and 8.7s.
#
# On main and NOT clean, the build STOPS. It does not fall back to a worktree
# and it does not carry on: a dirty or half-merged main is a machine in a
# state its owner did not intend, and no build system can work out what they
# meant. Guessing here would either compile something nobody asked for or
# silently ignore work in progress. The programmer is told what is wrong and
# left to decide — that is the whole of the policy.
