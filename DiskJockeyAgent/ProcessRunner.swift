/// Run a child process and collect what it wrote, without deadlocking.
///
/// # Why this is a second copy
///
/// `DiskJockeyLibrary` has the same helper, and the app targets use it.
/// This agent cannot: it is not a target in the Xcode project, it is a
/// standalone executable compiled on its own, and it links no framework
/// of ours. A shared file would have to be shared across a boundary
/// that does not exist.
///
/// The two must stay in step. Both carry the reasoning below so a change
/// to one is visibly a change to a decision, not to a detail.
///
/// # The deadlock
///
/// A pipe holds roughly 64 KiB. Once it is full the child's next `write`
/// blocks until somebody drains it — so a parent that waits before
/// reading has arranged for each side to wait on the other:
///
/// ```swift
/// try proc.run()
/// proc.waitUntilExit()                              // waits for the child
/// let out = pipe.fileHandleForReading.readToEnd()   // never reached
/// ```
///
/// `hdiutil info -plist` lists every attached image on the machine and
/// passes 64 KiB easily. `diskprobe` emits a JSON description of a whole
/// disk. Both were called this way.
///
/// Reading first fixes one pipe. Reading two pipes one after the other
/// does not: if the child fills the second while this side is blocked on
/// the first, the standoff happens one stream over. So both are drained
/// concurrently — stderr on a private queue, stdout on the calling
/// thread — and the wait comes last.
///
/// A stream nobody wants still needs a destination that cannot fill,
/// which is what `runDiscardingOutput` uses `/dev/null` for. An unread
/// `Pipe()` is the same bug wearing a different hat.
